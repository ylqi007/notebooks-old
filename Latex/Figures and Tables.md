## Figures and Tables

### Inserting Images

* LaTex can not manage images by itself, so we need to use the `graphicx` package. To use it, we include following line in the preamble: `\usepackage{graphicx}`
* The command `\graphicspath{ {./images/} }` tells LATEX that the images are kept in a folder named `images` under the directory of the main document.
* The `\includegraphics{universe}` command is the one that actually included the image in the document. **Here `universe` is the name of the file containing the image without the extension.**
* Note: *The file extension is allowed to be included, but it's a good  idea to omit it. If the file extension is omitted it will prompt LaTeX  to search for all the supported formats.*
